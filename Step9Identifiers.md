# Digital Object Identifier (DOI)  

## Help people identify you and your work by using ORCID Id's and DOI's for your research work.

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique identifier that identifies digital objects. The object, itself, may change physical locations, but the DOI assigned to that object will never change. Journal/Scholalry publishers assign DOIs to electronic copies of individual articles in journals they publish. 
### Key messages:
*DOIs can be created for data sets and associated outputs (eg grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc) - DOIs for data are equivalent with DOIs for other scholarly publications
*DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both metrics and altmetrics)
*Resolvable DOIs provide easy online access to research data for discovery, attribution and reuse
*DOIs are a persistent identifier and as such carry expectations of curation, persistent access and rich metadata

Beginner | Ensure data you associate with a publication has a DOI- your library is the best group to talk to for this. <br/>Register for an ORCID id- talk to your library about the best way or go to https://orcid.org/ |
Intermediate | Ensure that your data has corresponding metadata to explain your columns and work.<br/>Populate your ORCID profile with your publications. Add your ID to your email signature so people can easily find you. |
Advanced | Let's get everything polished |
