### What is a File Naming Convention?

A File Naming Convention (FNC) is a framework or protocol if you like for naming your files in a way that describes what files contain and importantly, how they relate to other files. It is essential prior to collecting data to establish an agreed FNC.

### What is a File Name? 
'File names' are the names that are listed in the file directory and that team members give to new files when they are saved for the first time.
---
### What are the benefits of using a file naming convention? 
Naming files consistently, logically and in a predictable manner will prevent against unorganised files, misplaced or lost data.  It could also prevent possible backlogs or project delays.  A file naming convention will ensure files are:
---
* Easier to proces - All team members won't have to over think the file naming process 
* Easier to facilitate access, retrieval and storage of files
* Easier to browse throough files saving time and effort 
* Harder to lose!
---
* Having logical and known naming conventions in place can also help you with version control (See step 5 Version Control for more information).
* Check for obsolete or duplicate records

### Coming up with a plan for your team on how to name files.
---
Some characters may have special meaning to the operating system so avoid using these characters when you are naming files. These characters include the following: / \ " ' * ; - ? [ ] ( ) ~ ! $ { } &lt > # @ & | space tab newline https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.osdevice/filename_conv.htm

### Beginner
Let's look at some easy naming convention for your data files and documents. Any dates are best stored with YYYY-MM-DD. Try to avoid spaces in your file names

### Advanced
Do you have a policy in your team around naming conventions? If not, this is a great way of getting everyone on the same page
