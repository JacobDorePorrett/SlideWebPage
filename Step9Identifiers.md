# Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Persisent indentifier (PiD)  

## Help people identify your research data and work by using DOI's at the end of your project

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) an unique identifier that is digital and the object can be digital or physical. The object, itself, may change digital or physical locations, but the DOI assigned to that object will never change. Journal/Scholalry publishers assign DOIs to electronic copies of individual articles in journals they publish. DOIs are assigned by either a publisher or an organsation (ie university or research institute) and the persistence of that DOI is managed and governed by the organisation and policeis.
### Key messages:
*DOIs can be created for DATA SETS and associated outputs (eg grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc) - DOIs for data are equivalent with DOIs for other scholarly publications
*DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both metrics and altmetrics)
*Resolvable DOIs provide easy online access to research data for discovery, attribution and reuse
*DOIs are a persistent identifier and as such carry expectations of curation, persistent access and rich metadata

Beginner | Ensure data you associate with a publication has a DOI- your library is the best group to talk to for this. <br/>Register for an ORCID id- talk to your library about the best way or go to https://orcid.org/ |
Intermediate | Ensure that your data has corresponding metadata to explain your columns and work.<br/>Populate your ORCID profile with your publications. Add your ID to your email signature so people can easily find you. |
Advanced | Let's get everything polished |
