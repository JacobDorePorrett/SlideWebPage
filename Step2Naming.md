# Step 2 - Naming Conventions

### Coming up with a plan for your team on how to name files.

### What is a File Naming Conventions

A File Naming Convention (FNC) is a framework or protocol if you like for naming your files in a way that describes what files contain and importantly, how they relate to other files.It is essential prior to collecting data to establish an agreed FNC

### What are the benefits of using a FNC?
Using a FNC will prevent against unorganised files, misplaced or lost data that could potentialy lead to backlogs.  The FNC will ensure files are:

#### * Easier to process
#### * Easier to read
#### * Harder to lose

Naming records consistently, logically and in a predictable way will distinguish similar records from one another at a glance, and by doing so will facilitate the storage and retrieval of records, which enable research team members to browse and retrieve file names more effectively and efficiently. Agreeing to use a particular convention will also make file naming easier for team members because they will not have to 're-think' the process each time.

The University of Edinburgh has a comprehensive yet easy to follow list (with examples and explanations) of 13 Rules for file naming conventions.

Having logical and known naming conventions in place can also help you with version control (See step 5 Version Control for more information).


Beginner | Let's look at some easy naming convention for your data files and documents. Any dates are best stored with YYYY-MM-DD. Try to avoid spaces in your file names |
Advanced | Do you have a policy in your team around naming conventions? If not, this is a great way of getting everyone on the same page |
