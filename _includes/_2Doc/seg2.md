### Coming up with a plan for your team on how to name files.
Former PhD student and subsequent founder of the Figshare platform, Mark Hahnel, typified a common challenge: *‘During my PhD I was never good at managing my research data. I had so many different file names for my data that I always struggled to find the correct file quickly and easily when it was requested. My former PI was so horrified upon seeing the state of my data organisation that she held an emergency lab book meeting with the rest of my group when l was leaving’*.

Your research team should agree on the following elements of a file name prior to data collection:
* Vocabulary - choose a standard vocabulary for file names, so that everyone uses a common language
* Punctuation - decide when to use punctuation symbols, capitals and hyphens
* Dates - agree on a logical use of dates so that they display chronologically i.e. YYYY-MM-DD
---
* Order - confirm which element should go first, so that files on the same theme are listed together and can therefore be found easily
* Numbers - specify the amount of digits that will be used in numbering so that files are listed numerically e.g. 01, 002, etc.

As previously suggested, consistent and meaningful naming of files and folders can make everyone’s life easier.  See this example below:

YYYYMMDD_SiteA_SensorB.CSV
 Date  Location   Sensor
Which when applied, would look like this below
20150621_Yaouk_Humidity.CSV

Some characters may have special meaning to the operating system so avoid using these characters when you are naming files. These characters include the following: / \ " ' * ; - ? [ ] ( ) ~ ! $ { } &lt > # @ & | space tab newline https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.osdevice/filename_conv.htm
