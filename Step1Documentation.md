# Step 1 - Documentation

Document what your procedures are for your experiment and where your results and working data are saved. Copy your lab notebook if you have one onto a digital format and save it to a safe place (research storage). Make sure these are saved somewhere that's accessible to your supervisor/team. It can be as simple as a word document on research space. 

Have you got a new staff member coming onboard to your team? They are a prime candidate to collate information and document as it will help them become familiar to the team and learn how the lab works.

Ideally you want to document anything that a lab member coming on board would need to know. Documentation is all about changing your Bus Factor - how many people on a project would need to be hit by a bus to make a project fail. Many times, projects can have a bus factor of one. Adding documentation means when someone goes on leave, needs to take leave suddenly or finishes their study, their work is preserved for your lab.

Documentation will also be important for any audits in your lab or if someone would like to reproduce your research.


 Beginner | <div align="left">Start with documenting in a text file the following:  <br/>Where files are stored<br/>Any safety documentation<br/>Where lab protocols, code or workflow information is stored or what programs you use to create your working files<br/>where the raw data was originally from<br/> Have this document automatically synced to the cloud </div>|
 Intermediate | Once you have the basics in place, go into detail on how your workflow goes from your raw data to the finished results. This can be anything from a downloaded function list from SPSS/Virtual Lab to code used to create it. |
 Advanced | Now that you've got a good basis, time to learn about Git Repositories and wikis.  |
