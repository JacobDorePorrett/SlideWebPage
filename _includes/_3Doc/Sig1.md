### Having a standard folder structure can keep your files neat and tidy and save you time looking for data.  

It can also help if you are sharing files with colleagues and having a standard place to put working data and documentation.

Like files, folders can also follow a naming convention. By prefixing with numbers, you can force your files to be ordered by the steps in your workflow. 

Probably the simplest way to document your structure - for your future reference - is to add a “README” file - a text file outlining the contents of the folder.
