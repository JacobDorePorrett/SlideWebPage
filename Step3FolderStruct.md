## Step 3
### Folder Structures
---
### Having a standard folder structure can keep your files neat and tidy and save you time looking for data.

Like files, folders too can follow a naming convention. By prefixing with numbers, you can force your files to be ordered by the steps in your workflow. Probably the simplest way to document your structure - for your future reference - is to add a “README” file - a text file outlining the contents of the folder. Please see example:

It can also help if you are sharing files with a colleague and there's a standard place to put working data or documentation.

### Beginner
Pick a dataset and illustrate how you currently organise your files.
(For the artists: Draw a picture that describes your current approach to file organisation)  
See if you can devise a better naming convention or note one or two improvements you could make to how you name your files

There's some really good folder template shapes around. [Here's one you are welcome to download and use URL](https://github.com/guereslib/MyResearchProjects/archive/master.zip) 
Or another you could try out if you prefer[from http://nikola.me/](http://nikola.me/assets/Folder_Template.zip)

### Advanced

Come up with a policy for your group for folder structures. You could create a template and put it in a downloadable location for them to get them started.
