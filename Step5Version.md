# Step 5 - Version Control

Are you keeping track of any versions or logs made by the software in use? Make sure you have a copy of every step you have completed and if possible, version numbers for the program you are using and any libraries. Programs change over time and this can alter your results if someone asks to replicate your work post publication.

## Step 5.1 - Never make alterations to your raw data files

Instead, make a copy of the raw data files and keep them somewhere safe (like Research Vault). That way, if you need to redo your work or you find an error earlier in your workflow, you have an original baseline to start from.

## Step 5.2 - Random Number Generator

If you are using random numbers in your research, save your random seed generator number as part of your working data. This way, you can later reproduce your results.

## Description

Beginner | Copy your raw data to a cloud storage solution such as Research Vault for safe keeping. Write down in a text file or in your documentation what you did to create your working data files and the steps you have taken. Write down what version software you are using too. |
Intermediate | Let's get into it |
Advanced | Start looking at Git for your code or workflow scripts. |
