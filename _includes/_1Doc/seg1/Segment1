Documentation is the idea of documenting your procedures for your experiment so that an outsider could understand the workings of your lab. 
---
This can include where your results and working data are saved. Copy your lab notebook if you have one onto a digital format and save it to a safe place (such as research storage). 

Make sure these are saved somewhere that's accessible to your supervisor/team. 

Note: 
Highlight that it can be as simple as a word document on research space or taking photos of your lab notebook and uploading them into a folder.
