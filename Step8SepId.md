# Step 8 - Separating identifying variables from your data

Separating or de-identifying your data generally occurs to protect an indiviuals privacy.  According to the Australian Privacy Act 1988, "personal information is de-identified if the information is no longer about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonaly identifiable".  De-identified information is no longer considered personal information and can be shared. More information on the Commomwealth Privacy Act can be located at https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00979

*De-identifiying* aims to allow data to be used by others for publishing, shaing and reuse without the possibility of individuals/location being re-identified. It may also be used to protect the location of archoalocial findings, cultural data of location of endanged species.  

Any identifiers (name, date of birth, address or geospatial locations etc) should be removed from main data set and replaced with a code/key.  The code/key is then preferrrably encrypted and stored separately. By storing de-identified data in a secure solution, you are meeting safety, controled, ethical, privacy and funding agency requirements.  

*Re-identifing* an individual is possible by recombining the de-indentifiable data set and the identifiers.  

## Australian practical guidance for De-identification (ARDC)
*Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)* formerly know as Australian National Data Service (ANDS) released a fabulous guide on De-indentification.  The De-identification guide is intended for reserachers who *own* a data set and wish to share safely with fellow researchers or for publishing of data. The guide can be located here https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/de-identifying-data  Below are examples of practical guidelines available nationally 

• The Australian Government’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and CSIRO Data61 have released a ‘De-identification Decision Making Framework’, which is a “practical guide to de-identification, focussing on operational advice”.  The guide will assist organisations that handle personal informaton to de-identify their data effectively. 
• The OAIC also provides high-level guidance on de-identification of data and information, outlining what de-identification is, and how it can be achieved.
• The Australian Government’s guidelines for the disclosure of health information, includes techniques for making a data set non-identifiable and example case studies.
• Australian National Statistical Service’s information on confidentiality and how to confidentialise data • Australian Bureau of Statistics’ National Statistical Service Handbook. Chapter 11 contains a summary of methods to maintain privacy. • Australian Bureau of Statistics’ A good practice guide to sharing your data with others
• med.data.edu.au gives information about anonymisation
• Office of the Information Commissioner Queensland’s guidance on de-identification techniques

## Tips for managing de-identificatioin (ARDC)
* Tips for managing de-identification:
• Plan de-identification early in the research as part of your data management planning
• Retain original unedited versions of data for use within the research team and for preservation
• Create a de-identification log of all replacements, aggregations or removals made
• Store the log separately from the de-identified data files
• Identify replacements in text in a meaningful way, e.g. in transcribed interviews indicate replaced text with [brackets] or use XML markup tags e.g. <anon>.....</anon>

## Management of identifiable data (ARDC)
Data may often need to be identifiable (i.e. contains personal information) during the process of research, e.g. for analysis. If data is identifiable then ethical and privacy requirements can be met through *access control and data security*. This may take the form of:

• Control of access through physical or digital means (e.g. passwords)
• Encryption of data, particularly if it is being moved between locations
• Ensuring data is not stored in an identifiable and unencrypted format when on easily lost items such as USB keys, laptops and external hard drives.
• Taking reasonable actions to prevent the inadvertent disclosure, release or loss of sensitive personal information.

It is intended for those who own a dataset and want to de-identify it for the purpose of sharing or publishing the data. https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/737211/De-identification.pdf
