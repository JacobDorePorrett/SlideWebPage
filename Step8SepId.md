# Step 8 - Separating identifying variables from your data

When dealing with health and medical, cultural or sensitive data including spatial location of mineral, archaeological findings or endangered species, its important to separate any identifiable variables from the rest of the data. 
* De-identification aims to allow data to be used by others for publishing, shaing and reuse without the possibility of individuals/location being identified. Any identifiers (name, date of birth, address or locations etc) should be removed from main data set and replaced with a code/key.  The code/key is then stored separately and preferrably encrypted. For example, if you are a Griffith Researcher, your data can reside in Research Drive, and you can store your encyrpted identifiers in Research Space.   Research Drive and Research Space are separate cloud solutions that meet the safety, controled, ethical and funding agency requirements.  
* Re-identifing an individual is possible by recombining the re-indentifiable data set and the identifiers

According to the Australian Privacy Act 1988, "personal information is de-identified if the information is no longer about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonaly identifiable".  De-identified information is no longer considered personal information and therefore, can be shared. https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00979

## Australian practical guidance for de-identification
• The Australian Government’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and CSIRO Data61 have a ‘De-identification Decision Making Framework’, which is a “practical guide to de-identification, focussing on operational advice”.
• The OAIC also provides high-level guidance on de-identification of data and information, outlining what de-identification is, and how it can be achieved.
• The Australian Government’s guidelines for the disclosure of health information, includes techniques for making a data set non-identifiable and example case studies.
• Australian National Statistical Service’s information on confidentiality and how to confidentialise data • Australian Bureau of Statistics’ National Statistical Service Handbook. Chapter 11 contains a summary of methods to maintain privacy. • Australian Bureau of Statistics’ A good practice guide to sharing your data with others
• med.data.edu.au gives information about anonymisation
