### What is Reproducible Research?
---
### Why is it Important?

Reflections by authors who had discovered they had made a mistake:

Retracted Image analysis paper
https://retractionwatch.com/2013/08/26/when-1-equals-2-the-result-is-a-retraction/

Where a cancer study was withdrawn by the Authors because they had lost the original data https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/19/author-to-retract-2016-cancer-study-because-of-missing-data/

It happens locally too:

### Let's look at some scenerios....
---
### What if a key person from your lab disappeared one day (family or personal emergency, no longer contactable)?

---
Could you all continue your work? 

Would you know where all your data is stored? 

Could you keep running effectively for 1 month? 

1 year?

Let's look at a few tools we can use to protect our research:
* Documentation
* Naming Conventions
* Folder Structures
* Automation
* Version Control

### Great! 
### By implementing these steps, we've already improved our processes!

Next Scenerio....

### Imagine you're travelling and lose your laptop bag with your external hard drives?
Or your office is robbed? 
Could you continue your work? 
Is your data backed up? 
Encrypted?

Let's look at a few tools we can use to protect our research:
* Backing up to the cloud
* Computer Security
* Deidentifying your data

### Computer Security
* Deidentifying your data
Note:
While Computer security isn't really about reproducibility, it is important. Plus I wanted to highlight encrypting hard drives

### Deidentifying your data

### Check us out! Our data and research is looking amazing!
---
Now let's look at after a project has finished

Next Scenario....
---
### Someone has published contradicting results to your published paper, and you've been asked to provide your data and methods. Could you?
---
We're already covered some things that can help us
---
* Storing our data in the cloud
* Documentation
* Versions of software
---
New tool
### Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Persistent identifier (PiD)
---?include=Step9Identifiers.md
---
Wow, that's 9 Reproducible Research things! 
---
What if we look at another Scenario?
---
if a research partner organization believes your "sensitive" data has been made available to others (ie a data breach). Could you show that steps were taken to avoid this or show that it couldn't happen?
---
Turns out, we can!
---
* Owncloud or Research Space – tracing who you have shared a file (Step 6 Cloud Backups)
* Computer encryption (Step 7 Good Computer Safety)
* General good computer safety – unique passwords and use Multi factor Auth when possible (Step 7 Good Computer Safety)
* Separating identified variables (Step 8- Deidentifying your data)
---
Amazing! We have so many new skills!
---
What changes are you going to make?
---
Thank you for coming!
