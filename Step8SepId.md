# Step 8 - Separating identifying variables from your data

When dealing with sensitive data, its really important to separate any identifiable variables from the rest of the data. Any identifiers should be stored in a completely separate place to the rest of your data. For example, if you are a Griffith Researcher, your data can reside in Research Drive, and you can store your identifiers in Research Space.   Research Drive and Research Space are separate cloud solutions that  meet the safety, ethical and funding agency requirements for health and medical, cultural and senstive data including spatial location of mineral or archaeological findings or endangered species.
