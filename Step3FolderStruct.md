# Step 3 - Folder Structures

### Having a standard folder structure can keep your files neat and tidy and save you time looking for data. It can also help if you are sharing files with a colleague and there's a standard place to put working data or documentation.

Beginner | There's some really good folder template shapes around. [Here's one you are welcome to download and use URL](https://github.com/guereslib/MyResearchProjects/archive/master.zip) Or another you could try out if you prefer[from http://nikola.me/](http://nikola.me/assets/Folder_Template.zip)|
Advanced | Come up with a policy for your group for folder structures. You could create a template and put it in a downloadable location for them to get them started. |
