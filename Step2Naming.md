# Step 2 - Naming Conventions

### Coming up with a plan for your team on how to name files benefits your team on a number of levels. It negates loosing files, makes processing in batches much easier and ensures that you can always find the files you need.

Why:
* Easier to process
* Easier to read
* Harder to lose

Beginner | Let's look at some easy naming convention for your data files and documents. Any dates are best stored with YYYY-MM-DD. Try to avoid spaces in your file names |
Advanced | Do you have a policy in your team around naming conventions? If not, this is a great way of getting everyone on the same page |
