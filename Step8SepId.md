# Step 8 - Separating identifying variables from your data

Separating or de-identifying your data generally occurs to protect an indiviuals privacy.  According to the Australian Privacy Act 1988, "personal information is de-identified if the information is no longer about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonaly identifiable".  De-identified information is no longer considered personal information and can be shared. More information on the Commomwealth Privacy Act can be located at https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00979

*De-identifiying* aims to allow data to be used by others for publishing, shaing and reuse without the possibility of individuals/location being re-identified. It may also be used to protect the location of archoalocial findings, cultural data of location of endanged species.  

Any identifiers (name, date of birth, address or geospatial locations etc) should be removed from main data set and replaced with a code/key.  The code/key is then preferrrably encrypted and stored separately. By storing de-identified data in a secure solution, you are meeting safety, controled, ethical, privacy and funding agency requirements.  

*Re-identifing* an individual is possible by recombining the de-indentifiable data set and the identifiers.  

Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) formerly know as Australian National Data Service (ANDS) released a fabulous guide on De-indentification.  The De-identification guide is intended for reserachers who *own* a data set and wish to share safely with fellow researchers or for publishing of data. The guide can be located here https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/de-identifying-data  

## Australian practical guidance for De-identification (ARDC)
• The Australian Government’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and CSIRO Data61 have released a ‘De-identification Decision Making Framework’, which is a “practical guide to de-identification, focussing on operational advice”.  The guide will assist organisations that handle personal informaton to de-identify their data effectively. 
• The OAIC also provides high-level guidance on de-identification of data and information, outlining what de-identification is, and how it can be achieved.
• The Australian Government’s guidelines for the disclosure of health information, includes techniques for making a data set non-identifiable and example case studies.
• Australian National Statistical Service’s information on confidentiality and how to confidentialise data • Australian Bureau of Statistics’ National Statistical Service Handbook. Chapter 11 contains a summary of methods to maintain privacy. • Australian Bureau of Statistics’ A good practice guide to sharing your data with others
• med.data.edu.au gives information about anonymisation
• Office of the Information Commissioner Queensland’s guidance on de-identification techniques
