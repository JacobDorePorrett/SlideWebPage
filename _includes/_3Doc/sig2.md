To develop a logical structure for your team, you need to consider the following points:
* Check to make sure there are no pre-existing folder structure agreements
* Name folders appropriately and in a meaningful manner. Don't use staff names and consider using the type of work
* Consistency - make sure you use the agreed structure/hierarchy 
---
* Structure folders hierarchically - start with a limited number of folders for the broader topics, and then create more specific folders within these
* Separate ongoing and completed work - as you start to create lots of folders and files, it is a good idea to start thinking about separating your older documents from those you are currently working on
---
* Backup â€“ ensure folders and files are backed up and retrievable in the event of a disaster. Griffith like most universities, have safe storage solutions.
* Clean up folders and files post project.
