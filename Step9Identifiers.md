# Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Persisent indentifier (PiD)  

## Help people identify your research data using a DOI's once you've completed your project

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is an unique alphanumeric string assigned by either a pubisher, organisation or agency that identifies content and provides a persistent link to its location on the Internet, whether the object is digital or physical. DOIs, are considered a type of persistent identifers (PiD).  Journal publishers assign DOIs to electronic copies of individual articles.   DOIs can be assigned by a publisher, orangisation or agency and are generally managed and governed by the relevant organisation and relating policies
### Key messages:
* DOIs can be created for DATA SETS and associated outputs (eg grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc) - DOIs for data are equivalent with DOIs for other scholarly publications
* DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both metrics and altmetrics)
* Resolvable DOIs provide easy online access to research data for discovery, attribution and reuse
* DOIs are a persistent identifier and as such carry expectations of curation, persistent access and rich metadata

Beginner | Ensure data you associate with a publication has a DOI- your library is the best group to talk to for this. 
Intermediate | Ensure that your data has corresponding metadata to explain your columns and work.
Advanced | Let's get everything polished |
